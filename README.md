# target-dummy

This project was created from a personal need to be able to test that API requests were being made from an unfamiliar system. It allows me to log the contents of those requests to a docker instance. It has been configured to run inside of docker with minimal configuration required.

Out of the box it only contains a few endpoints. Extending this project to include more endpoint functionality is planned when I find the time.
